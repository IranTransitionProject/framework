# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Iran Transition Project.

## Before You Contribute

**Read `GOVERNANCE.md` first.** This project has a strict mission constraint:
rigorous, impartial, publicly available analysis. Contributions that introduce
factional alignment, political advocacy, or unsupported claims will not be merged
regardless of their other merits.

---

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

**All contributors must sign the CLA before any pull request is merged.**

This is not negotiable and is not bureaucratic friction — it exists to preserve
the project's ability to offer alternative licensing to policy institutions and
governments that cannot accept copyleft terms, while keeping the public license
open for everyone else.

**What the CLA does:**
- Grants the project the right to sublicense your contribution
- Does NOT transfer your copyright — you retain full ownership of your work
- Applies to all future contributions once signed

**How to sign:**
The CLA bot will prompt you automatically when you open your first pull request.
Sign electronically in that flow. It takes under a minute.

If you have questions about the CLA before contributing, contact:
admin@irantransitionproject.org

## Analytical Standards

Contributions must adhere to the project's epistemic framework:

**Tagging requirements:**
- `[Fact]` — directly verifiable, multi-source
- `[Inference]` — reasoned from facts, logic stated
- `[Uncertain]` — single source, contested, or extrapolated
- `[Speculation]` — acknowledged hypothesis

**Source standards:**
- Primary sources preferred over secondary
- Iranian state media cited for claims only, not treated as factual
- Diaspora sources tagged `[DIASPORA SOURCE]` and cross-checked
- All sources logged in the module's source log

**Factional neutrality:**
The test for any claim is: *what must be true regardless of who governs?*
Analysis that depends on a preferred faction winning is not neutral analysis.

## What We Need Most

- Persian-language source integration and translation
- Subject matter review (political science, security studies, economics, law)
- Methodological critique — where the framework is wrong, say so explicitly
- Historical case study analysis relevant to transition dynamics
- Verification of existing citations and confidence bandings

---

## What We Are Not Looking For

- Advocacy content for any political faction or opposition group
- Policy recommendations tied to specific foreign government positions
- Content that cannot be sourced or tagged per the epistemic framework above

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo
2. Make changes in a feature branch
3. Sign the CLA when prompted
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of what changed and why
5. Reference any sources added in the PR description

Expect review feedback focused on analytical standards, not political agreement.
