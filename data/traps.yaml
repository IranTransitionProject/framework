  title: "The IRGC Economic Bootstrapping Problem (PRIMARY)"
  category: core_transition
  session_added: 1
  confidence: "[Inference -- High]"
  mechanism: >-
    Economic reform requires dismantling IRGC economic capture (25-40% of GDP, tax-exempt,
    sanctions-evasion monopoly). But dismantling IRGC economic assets collapses employment for
    millions and removes the sanctions-evasion channels that currently keep the economy alive
    (however poorly). The IRGC cannot be reformed economically without first establishing
    alternative employment and trade channels -- but alternative channels cannot be established
    while IRGC controls the economic infrastructure.
  circular_structure: >-
    Economic reform requires IRGC dismantlement --> IRGC dismantlement causes economic collapse
    --> economic collapse causes security crisis --> security crisis prevents economic reform.
  resolution_path: >-
    Phased approach -- freeze IRGC assets under transitional authority (Phase 1 buffer),
    establish parallel economic channels with international support (Phase 2 rebuild), then
    gradually transfer/privatize/dissolve IRGC economic entities (Phase 3 structural).
    Requires international sanctions relief to create the alternative channels.

        The deal's theory of the case assumes a unitary negotiating counterpart. In reality,
        three segments exist: theological opponents (~5-15%, veto-capable), institutional resisters
        (~40-50%, friction-generating), and genuine pragmatists (~15-25%, the actual negotiating
        counterparts). Washington is negotiating with Segment 3 but deal survival requires
        overcoming Segments 1+2 -- who collectively control 45-65% of institutional power and
        are not at the table. The 2022 Vienna JCPOA near-miss demonstrates this structural failure mode.

  mechanism: >-
    Transition requires security forces to maintain order. But the existing security forces
    (IRGC, Basij) are the instruments of repression. Keeping them creates continuity of oppression.
    Dissolving them creates security vacuum. Reforming them requires trust from the population
    they just massacred -- trust that does not exist.
  circular_structure: >-

    will not accept IRGC/Basij --> alternative security forces do not exist --> disorder -->
    need for security forces.
  resolution_path: >-
    Differentiated approach -- Artesh (less ideological, broader social base) serves as
    transitional security force. IRGC combat units confined to barracks. Basij formally dissolved
    with individual-level vetting (not blanket exclusion). International security guarantees or
    peacekeeping for nuclear facilities.

  circular_structure: >-

    Transitional hybrid -- technocratic administration drawn from non-IRGC civil service and
    vetted diaspora returnees, operating under political authority established by constitutional
    process (elected constituent assembly or equivalent). The technocratic layer provides

  mechanism: >-
    Transition requires delegitimizing the theological framework (A8) AND dismantling the social
    reproduction system (A9). But the parallel society population of 2-10 million has been educated
    in IRGC schools, raised in IRGC compounds, employed through IRGC economic networks, and
    socialized within IRGC communities for up to three generations. Delegitimizing the framework
    means not only telling enforcers that their violence was murder but also stripping their
    families of housing, education, employment, and social identity simultaneously.
  circular_structure: >-
    Transition requires dissolving parallel society --> dissolution creates population of millions
    with no homes, schools, jobs, identity --> desperate population resists violently --> resistance
    requires security response --> security response requires the very institutions being dissolved.
  resolution_path: >-
    Economic absorption first: create alternative employment, housing, and educational pathways
    before any institutional dissolution. Tiered approach: (1) Ideological architects (Haqqani
    circle, senior IRGC ideological officers) -- accountability track. (2) Economically dependent
    majority -- integration track with economic alternatives + community reintegration.
    (3) Youth raised in the system -- educational reform track (longest timeline, most consequential).
    Theological dimension requires intra-Shia engagement (Sistani, Qom marjas). Residential
    transition: compound infrastructure converted to public use, absorbing population rather

  mechanism: >-
    A US-Iran nuclear deal intended to prevent proliferation may paradoxically enable the regime's

        Resolution demands are set at levels Iran has explicitly stated are non-starters. Resolution
        designed to ensure no deal survives Senate review. Fifth failure layer for Brief #5 architecture.

  title: "The Two-Track Incoherence"
  category: negotiation_deal
  session_added: 13
  confidence: "[Inference -- High for structural mechanism; Med for Track B operational details]"
  mechanism: >-
    The US is simultaneously pursuing two mutually undermining policy tracks. Track A: Geneva
    nuclear negotiations with existing regime. Track B: Transition planning with diaspora
    business leaders and opposition figures (Kushner assembling 'Florida Group,' Palm Beach
    consultations). Track A requires the regime to believe its counterpart is committed to a
    deal preserving the regime. Track B signals that the counterpart is simultaneously planning
    its replacement. The regime knows about Track B -- Araghchi has demanded Track B be halted.
  circular_structure: >-
    Deal requires Iranian trust --> trust requires US commitment to regime preservation --> US
    simultaneously plans regime replacement --> regime knows about replacement planning -->
    regime reduces negotiating commitment --> deal fails --> US escalates Track B --> regime
    further entrenches --> both tracks fail.
  resolution_path: >-
    The tracks must be sequenced, not simultaneous. Either commit to diplomacy with genuine
    conditionality (pausing visible transition planning) or commit to transition support
    (withdrawing from nuclear negotiations). The current configuration maximizes the probability
    of the worst outcome: failed diplomacy providing pretext for an unprepared strike without
    transition infrastructure.

      title: "Asymmetric information problem"
      content: >-
        Track A and Track B share the same personnel (Kushner operates in both). Information
        and assessments from one track contaminate the other. Diaspora figures providing Track B
        input shape US assessment of regime durability -- potentially making US less willing to
        offer meaningful concessions in Track A because they've internalized 'regime will fall
        anyway' framing.

      title: "Who benefits"
      content: >-
        Israel (pushing maximalist strike scenario), Graham coalition (Track B provides fallback
        narrative), Eschatological faction (Track B validates theological opposition to engagement),
        Gulf equilibrium beneficiaries (hollow deal becomes more likely). Who does NOT benefit:
        the Iranian population.
  actors: ["Kushner", "Witkoff", "Araghchi", "Graham", "Israel", "Mirbagheri/Paydari"]
  detection_signal: >-
    Evidence (verified): The National (Feb 5, 2026) confirmed Kushner assembling Iranian-American
    business leaders. CNN (Feb 18) confirmed both tracks operating simultaneously in Geneva.
    Graham itinerary (Feb 13-22: Munich rally -> Netanyahu -> MBZ -> MBS) is Track B coalition's
    diplomatic circuit.
