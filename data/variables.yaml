monitoring_notes:
- Variables require weekly recheck on flow and threshold tables. Stock variables recheck monthly or on significant event.
- 'v1.2 NOTE (still active): Given active mourning cycle, Hormuz exercise tempo, and campaign-ready US force posture, flow and threshold variables should be rechecked every 3-5 days until situation stabilizes
  or transitions to a new phase.'
- 'v1.3 NOTE: Paydari trajectory and Ghalibaf timeline variables are election-cycle dependent (2028); monitor Guardian Council candidate approval patterns in 2027 as leading indicator. Judicial moratorium
  threshold is instantaneous upon any transition event -- no warning lag.'
- 'v1.5 NOTE (CRITICAL): Trump deadline variables, Iran proposal delivery, Geneva Round 3 outcome, and student protest expansion require DAILY monitoring through at least March 6. The system is in maximum-velocity
  phase. Multiple variables are converging on a ~10-day decision window (Feb 22 to ~March 3). Any individual variable crossing its threshold may cascade the others.'
- 'v1.7 NOTE (Session 16): IAEA Board (March 2) creates third independent clock converging with Geneva Round 3 and Trump deadline. This is the tightest multi-clock convergence documented in the project.
  Student protest expansion (12+ universities) now modeled as independent internal resistance clock (A12.3.6). Caine/Cooper dynamics create new variable in Washington Patience Clock. All three factors require
  monitoring through at least March 6.'

  trend: IAEA censure vote + possible UNSC referral
  insight: 'Three-clock convergence: Geneva Round 3 (Feb 26) + IAEA Board (March 2-6) + Trump deadline (~March 1-6) compress into single 8-day window. If IAEA refers Iran to UNSC concurrent with failed
    Round 3, political predicate for strikes strengthens on multiple independent axes. IAEA censure is independently triggerable regardless of Geneva outcome -- feeds Obs 014 (Three Clocks) and A12.6 Phase
    assessment.'

    excluded from Iran meetings -- civilian leadership controlling military options. Two readings: (a) genuine strain signal advancing regime Phase 3 assessment; (b) deliberate leak to prevent regime slow-play.
    Regime likely perceiving this as opponent strain indicator (A12.5.1). Monitoring: Caine public statements; Cooper inclusion/exclusion; munitions resupply pace.'
