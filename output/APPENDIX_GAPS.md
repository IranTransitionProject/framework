| gap-basij-active-nominal | ITB-A9 | Basij active vs. nominal membership | Strike triggers domestic unrest; deployment capacity critical. | ELEVATED |
| gap-underground-capacity | ITB-D, ITB-G | Underground organizational capacity inside Iran | Strike power vacuum; who fills it? | ELEVATED |
| gap-syria-veterans-domestic | ITB-A9 | Syria veteran count in domestic security | IRGC-Hezbollah activation means Syria commanders redeployed. | ELEVATED |
| gap-regime-strain-assessment | ITB-A12 | Regime internal assessment of US strain | Determines regime Phase 3 transition timing. No direct access under blackout. | OPEN |
| gap-backchannel-substance | ITB-A12 | Backchannel substance (not atmospherics) | Determines whether diplomatic track has real content. | OPEN |
| G14-01 | ISA-SCENARIOS, ITB-A | Larijani factional positioning vs. Mirbagheri/Paydari | Larijani and Paydari documented opponents since 2011 split. | FILLED -- Integrated into Brief #5 v3.0, Obs 016. |
| G14-02 | ITB-A, ITB-B | Defense Council composition and Shamkhani authority | May become post-strike power center. Composition unknown. | OPEN |
| G14-03 | ITB-B | IRGC retaliation capacity post-June 2025 | Determines regime response options if strikes occur. | OPEN |
| G14-04 | ITB-B | Artesh unit-level loyalty (upgraded from existing) | Now blocking under strike scenario. | OPEN |
| G12-01 | ITB-F12, ISA-SCENARIOS | Current NIOC board composition -- IRGC vs. civilian leadership | Determines baseline for NIOC de-designation conditionality design. | OPEN |

| gap-historical-phase-mapping | ITB-A12 | Historical phase-mapping across past coercive-endurance cycles | Would validate 5-phase model against empirical record. | OPEN |
| gap-eschatological-disruption-speed | ITB-A12 | Eschatological disruption activation speed | Determines Phase 3->4 fracture timing. | OPEN |
