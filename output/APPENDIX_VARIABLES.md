# APPENDIX A: VARIABLES DASHBOARD

### TABLE 1: CRITICAL STOCK VARIABLES

| Variable | Current Value | Trend | Ratio / Critical Insight | Confidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Supreme Leader Age** | 86 (Khamenei) | Aging | **Single point of failure: Only 2nd holder; no tested succession** | [High] |
| **IRGC Economic Share** | 25-40% GDP | Entrenched | **Parallel state: Cannot reform economy without IRGC confrontation** | [Low/Med] |
| **HEU Inventory** | ~400 kg (diplomatic ref) | [Unknown] | **Nuclear breakout: Timeline uncertain post-Midnight Hammer** | [Low] |
| **Protest Deaths (confirmed)** | 7,015+ (HRANA: 6,425 adult protesters, 146 minors, 214 security forces, 57 non-participants) | Accumulating | **Legitimacy hemorrhage: Each death deepens rupture. 26+ death sentences issued; 8,843 indictments = industrial judicial pipeline.** | [Med] |
| **Population** | ~88-90M | Slow growth | **Youth bulge: Large 18-35 cohort most discontented** | [Med] |
| **Diaspora Size** | 2-4M | Stable | **Skills reservoir: No coordination mechanism** | [Low] |
| **National Identity Strength** | HIGH | Durable | **Territorial integrity anchor: Strongest vs. Iraq/Libya/Syria** | [Med] |
| **Theological Violence Doctrine** | ACTIVE (institutionalized) | Self-reproducing | **Identity lock: IRGC violence is theologically authorized, creating deeper binding with each act; no clean transition precedent** | [Med] |
| **IRGC Parallel Society Population** | 2-10M (three-tier estimate) | Stable/slowly growing | **Core (~500K-1M) ideologically bound; majority (~2-4M) economically captive** | [Inference -- Low/Med] |
| **Educational Pipeline Throughput** | Shahed: ~405K; Basij Student Org: 4.6M claimed; IHU: ~6K; ISU: ~1-2K | Active | **Pipeline wide at base, narrow at top: mass socialization to elite selection** | [Fact/Inference -- Med] |
| **Syria-Trained Personnel in Domestic Command** | [GAP -- unquantified] | Increasing (promotion pattern) | **Doctrine transfer institutional, not anecdotal: IHU academizes Syria methods** | [Inference -- Med] |
| **Taqiyyah Analytical Exposure** | ACTIVE (institutionalized in ISU, IHU, diplomatic corps) | Self-reproducing | **Western analytical models systematically degraded by theologically authorized strategic deception** | [Inference -- Med] |
| **(v1.1)** **Pragmatist Institutional Weight** | ~15-25% of elite power structure | Unknown | **Segment 3 controls negotiating table but not implementation machinery; insufficient to deliver compliance against Segments 1+2** | [Inference -- Med] |
| **(v1.1)** **Combined A10+Resister Weight** | ~45-65% of institutional power | Likely increasing (succession) | **Two-front opposition: theological veto + bureaucratic friction. Together create structural non-compliance** | [Inference -- Med] |
| **(v1.3)** **Majlis Factional Composition (12th Majlis)** | 233/290 principlist (~80%); Paydari ascendant in Tehran; Ghalibaf as Speaker | Capturing further (ratchet dynamic) | **12th Majlis is the most hardline in IRI history. Reformists boycotted. 41% turnout = election is already near-intra-regime selection. Transition cannot rely on current Majlis as transitional vehicle.** | [Fact — High; trend projection Inference — Med] |
| **(v1.3)** **Judicial Reconstruction Capacity** | ZERO usable secular bench; ~70,000 Bar Association lawyers; ~89,000 judiciary employees (all functions) | Static until transition begins | **Single hardest transition task. No secular-trained judges to restore. 47 years of systematic destruction. Bar Association is only survivable institution with independence claim. Bootstrapping problem is absolute.** | [Inference — High confidence; personnel figures Fact — Med] |
| **(v1.6)** **Coercive-Endurance Cycle Phase** | Phase 2→3 transition | Advancing (slowly) | **A12.6 current events mapping** | [Med-High] |
| **(v1.6)** **Opponent Strain Perception** | Uncertain -- regime assessing | Unknown | **No direct access under blackout** | [Low] |

### TABLE 2: CRITICAL FLOW VARIABLES

| Variable | Current Value | Trend | Ratio / Critical Insight | Confidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rial Exchange Rate** | Collapsed | Deteriorating | **Economic trigger: Currency crisis initiated uprising** | [Med] |
| **Brain Drain** | ~$150B+/yr (est.) | Accelerating | **Dual reading: Talent loss domestically; skills reservoir abroad** | [Low] |
| **Protest Intensity** | [GAP] | Unknown (blackout) | **Information vacuum: Cannot assess trajectory** | [Low] |
| **Negotiation Momentum** | Round 2 complete (Feb 17-18); "guiding principles" agreed; two-week draft exchange proposed | Ambiguous â€” thin diplomatic progress concurrent with maximum military buildup | **"Guiding principles" < "framework agreement." Vance: Iran hasn't acknowledged all red lines. Trump strike decision NOT yet made (WSJ Feb 19). Oil markets read talks as slightly de-escalatory (Brent -2.3%).** | [Med] |
| **Military Buildup Rate** | 2 CSGs + F-22s + F-35s + F-15s + F-16s + KC-135s + AWACS + Patriot; 250+ cargo flights | Accelerating | **Largest US air deployment since 2003 Iraq invasion (WSJ). US officials: supports "several weeks" of operations. Exceeds deterrence posture â€” campaign-ready. See ITB-F §F1.1 v2.1.** | [High] |
| **Regime Internal Dissent** | Multiple signals | [Unknown] | **Hardliner vs. negotiator: Active internal contest** | [Med] |
| **IRGC Economic Patronage Capacity** | 30-60% GDP | Under sanctions pressure | **Erosion of patronage = erosion of non-ideological loyalty; primary binding mechanism is degrading** | [Inference -- Med] |
| **(v1.1)** **Washington Patience Clock** | Active (~weeks-months remaining) | Compressing | **Shorter of two clocks governs. Trump rhetoric + Netanyahu pressure + Congressional hawkishness.** | [Med] |
| **(v1.1)** **Succession Clock** | Active (months-years) | Accelerating (Khamenei diminished) | **Mirbagheri faction trajectory upward. Each month increases probability of eschatological successor.** | [Med] |
| **(v1.1)** **Deal Implementation Friction Rate** | Not yet measurable | Projected high | **2022 Vienna near-miss as baseline: institutional resistance killed near-complete deal. Current deal requires more reform = more friction.** | [Inference -- Med] |
| **(v1.2)** **40-Day Mourning Cycle (Chehelom)** | ACTIVE â€” first cycle initiated Feb 17-18 for Jan 8-9 victims | Self-reinforcing if new deaths occur | **1978-79 revolution escalated through this exact mechanism. Security forces fired on mourners in Abdanan (1 reported killed) and clashed with mourners in Mashhad. Mourning spread beyond cemeteries into streets/hospitals. Cultural shift: music, dance, fireworks replacing Shia religious mourning forms = regime losing control of symbolic register. Regime co-optation attempt (Khamenei "martyrs" framing) rejected. Next critical inflection: ~late Mar 2026 (second chehelom) coincides with Nowruz. See ISA-SCENARIOS Obs 011.** | [Med] |
| **(v1.2)** **Hormuz Escalation Tempo** | IRGC live-fire exercise + first-ever Strait closure announcement (Feb 16-18) | Escalating | **New deterrence threshold crossed. Anti-ship missiles fired, drones/subs deployed from three islands. Russia-China naval presence concurrent. Mine warfare capability latent but demonstrated intent. Any incident (drone, speedboat, mine) during heightened operations = potential casus belli. See ITB-B §B8.** | [Med] |
| **(v1.3)** **Paydari Parliamentary Trajectory** | 2024 baseline: largest Tehran bloc, ~60–80 seats estimated | Accelerating (ratchet mechanism active) | **Self-tightening feedback: massacre validates maximalist strategy, IRGC institutional alignment, disciplined Basij voter base, new proportional representation law favors organized parties. Paydari is the most organized faction. 2028 projection: working majority possible if Khamenei cannot or does not constrain.** | [Inference — Med] |
| **(v1.3)** **Ghalibaf Strategic Timeline** | ACTIVE — Speaker, presidential ambitions, Article 111 positioning | Compressing (2028 election is hard deadline) | **A6.10 ratchet creates existential deadline: if Paydari captures Speakership in 2028, Ghalibaf loses Art. 111 succession role, presidential platform, and "system manager" positioning simultaneously. Three options: align with Paydari, seek Khamenei direct protection, make a succession move before 2028. Interacts with ITB-A11 Pinochet mechanism.** | [Inference — Med] |
| **(v1.5)** **Larijani Authority Scope** | Effectively running Iran; Pezeshkian sidelined | Expanding | **Shadow governance since early Jan 2026. Khamenei delegated day-to-day governance. Araghchi authorization chain runs through Larijani, not president. Liaising with Russia, Qatar, Oman. Overseeing nuclear negotiations. In charge of January protest crushing. Implications: wrong interlocutor thesis confirmed at deepest level (Obs 016). Monitoring: presidential statements, SNSC directives, Araghchi authorization chain.** | [Fact -- High; NYT, six senior Iranian officials, three IRGC members] |
| **(v1.5)** **Trump Deadline Countdown** | ~8-13 days remaining (from Feb 22) | Counting down | **Trump stated Feb 19: "10, 15 days, pretty much maximum." Aligns with IAEA Board (Mar 2), full force readiness (mid-Mar), Ford CSG arrival. "Not scientific" per US official -- pressure tool, not commitment -- but military buildup makes it credible. Washington Patience Clock (Obs 010) now has concrete expiry: ~March 1-6. Monitoring: Trump statements, military deployment completion signals.** | [Fact -- High for statement; Inference -- Med for expiry date interpretation] |
| **(v1.7)** **Student Protest Expansion** | 12+ universities, 4 cities, Day 4+ | Accelerating -- institutional infrastructure emerging | **Feb 21-24: University of Tehran, Al-Zahra, Sharif, Amirkabir, Shahid Beheshti, Science & Technology, Khajeh Nasir, Science & Culture (Tehran); Isfahan University of Technology; Ferdowsi, Sajjad (Mashhad); Shiraz. Government spokesperson acknowledged student grievances while insisting on "red lines." Some universities moved classes online through March 20 (Nowruz). Students escalated to prosecutor general (judicial, not disciplinary). Sharif website hacked to pre-revolution name. NOW MODELED AS INDEPENDENT INTERNAL CLOCK (A12.3.6): student front operates on academic calendar rhythm distinct from mourning cycle, creates two-front resource allocation strain degrading regime capacity to sustain external coercive-endurance cycle. Monitoring: spread to non-university sectors (workers/bazaar); regime judicial vs. military response; campus shutdown duration; Nowruz convergence.** | [Fact -- High; Al Jazeera, NPR, Iran International, CBS, NCRI] |
| **(v1.5)** **IRGC-Hezbollah Activation** | Direct IRGC operational control | Escalating | **IRGC officers arrived from Iran, rebuilding Hezbollah military capabilities, personally briefing fighters across Lebanon, meeting with missile units. Israel struck 3 Beqaa sites (12 killed including senior officer, 50+ wounded). Iran pressuring Hezbollah to fight if US strikes. Expands S2 from bilateral to multi-front regional. Monitoring: IDF strike frequency; Hezbollah statements; IRGC personnel movements.** | [Inference -- Med-High; Al-Arabiya via Hezbollah-proximate sources + IDF pattern] |
| **(v1.5)** **Enrichment Position Gap** | Executive flexible, legislative rigid, Iran claiming no demand | Widening | **Systematic contradiction: Trump/S.Res.212 = zero enrichment; Witkoff told Araghchi "zero" (Axios); same official signals "token enrichment" flexibility; Araghchi claims US "has not asked for zero enrichment." Gap between what each side says was said is itself a negotiation risk factor. Validates Three Clocks model (Obs 014/017). "Token enrichment" satisfies none of three clocks fully. Monitoring: Congressional statements post-Axios; Araghchi proposal content.** | [Fact -- High for contradiction; Inference -- Med for structural interpretation] |
| **(v1.5)** **War Readiness** | All forces at highest alert; missile launchers deployed | Near-peak | **Ballistic missile launchers deployed on western borders (near Israel) and southern Persian Gulf shores (near US bases). Defense Council created under Shamkhani (survived Israeli assassination Jun 2025). Four-layer succession for every key position. Pentagon presented options including targeting Khamenei and Mojtaba (Axios Feb 22). 90% kinetic action estimate from anonymous Trump adviser. Monitoring: force deployment completion; ammunition pre-positioning.** | [Fact -- High for deployments; Inference -- Med for intent interpretation] |
| **(v1.5)** **Iran Proposal Delivery** | Expected "in 2-3 days" per Araghchi (from Feb 21) | Pending | **Araghchi (CBS Feb 22): "A better deal than JCPOA is possible," "No need for so many details. Agree on basic things." Content unknown. Arrival before Trump deadline is the key timing variable. Monitoring: delivery to Witkoff; content leaked or described.** | [Fact -- Med for timeline; content unknown] |
| **(v1.5)** **Next Geneva Round** | Confirmed Feb 26 (Thursday) by Oman FM | Confirmed | **Badr Albusaidi (Oman FM) tweeted Feb 22 confirming Geneva "this Thursday" with "positive push to go the extra mile towards finalizing the deal." If Iran's proposal arrives and Geneva Round 3 occurs Feb 26, this is the last diplomatic off-ramp before Trump deadline window opens. Monitoring: Albusaidi confirmation; Araghchi travel; Witkoff travel.** | [Fact -- High; Oman FM public confirmation] |
| **(v1.6)** **Phase transition velocity** | Phase 2→3 | Slow (weeks) | **US military completion + adversary cost signals** | [Med] |
| **(v1.6)** **Eschatological disruption activation** | Dormant→Active | Will accelerate at Phase 3→4 boundary | **Phase 4 indicators emerging** | [Med] |

### TABLE 3: THRESHOLD / TRIGGER VARIABLES

| Variable | Threshold | Current Distance | Scenario Trigger | Confidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nuclear Deal** | NEGOTIATIONS ACTIVE â€” Round 2 complete, "guiding principles" only | Two-week draft exchange window; no Round 3 date set | **Binary compressed: "Guiding principles" buys ~2 weeks. Force posture now campaign-ready concurrent with draft exchange. Deal/strike decision likely within weeks, not months.** | [Med] |
| **Second US Strike** | POSSIBLE â€” force posture now campaign-ready | Talks failure + provocation + Trump decision (not yet made per WSJ Feb 19) | **Category A shock: Force sized for multi-week campaign (largest since 2003). Clean attribution, mobilization trigger. Hormuz retaliation now explicitly signaled by Iran. Israeli officials pushing "maximalist scenario targeting regime change."** | [Med] |
| **Khamenei Succession** | LATENT | Health event or death | **Regime existential: No tested mechanism** | [Med] |
| **Internet Blackout** | ACTIVE | Imposed Jan 8 | **Information vacuum** | [High] |
| **Foreign Militia Presence** | DEPLOYED | Jan 2026 | **Sovereignty violation: Foreign forces vs. own citizens** | [High] |
| **EU IRGC Terror Designation** | ACTIVE | Jan 29, 2026 | **Diplomatic isolation** | [High] |
| **(v1.2)** **Mourning Cycle Escalation** | ACTIVE â€” Cycle 1 initiated | New deaths during mourning (confirmed: at least 1 in Abdanan) | **Self-reinforcing mechanism: Each death creates new 40-day cycle. If Cycle 2 initiates (~late Mar), coincides with Nowruz. 1978-79 precedent: this mechanism produced revolution.** | [Med] |
| **(v1.3)** **Paydari Parliamentary Majority** | PROJECTED — not yet reached | 2028 election; earlier if Khamenei health event disrupts balancing mechanism | **Category B institutional shift: If Paydari achieves working majority in 13th Majlis — (a) nuclear weapons advocacy becomes legislative program capable of passing formal bills; (b) Ghalibaf loses Art. 111 succession position; (c) Majlis-as-transitional-vehicle assumption in ISA-SCENARIOS must be replaced with parallel constituent assembly model; (d) fatwa reinterpretation becomes legislative possibility (see ITB-A8 §A8.1).** | [Inference — Med] |
| **(v1.3)** **Judicial Moratorium (Day 1 threshold)** | NOT YET — requires transition event | Day 1 of any transition scenario | **Non-negotiable first act: Iran's execution rate (1,791 in 2025; 336 in November alone) means any transitional authority that does not impose an immediate moratorium loses legitimacy on human rights grounds within hours. Simultaneously, revolutionary courts must be declared constitutionally void (they have no constitutional basis). These two acts define the new system before anything else. Delay is not a viable option.** | [Inference — High confidence] |
| **(v1.5)** **Larijani Shadow Governance** | ACTIVE -- since early Jan 2026 | Khamenei delegation (already occurred) | **Constitutional ambiguity: Larijani holds no constitutional authority for day-to-day governance (SNSC is advisory). His power derives from Khamenei's personal delegation, making it fragile to Khamenei health event. Post-Khamenei, Larijani's authority evaporates unless formalized. Creates immediate power vacuum in succession scenario.** | [Fact -- High; NYT sourcing] |
| **(v1.5)** **Defense Council** | ACTIVE -- newly created | War preparation assessment (already occurred) | **New institutional body headed by Shamkhani. Composition unknown (G14-02 GAP). May become post-strike power center. Represents institutional adaptation for wartime governance outside constitutional structure.** | [Fact -- Med; NYT, limited detail] |
| **(v1.5)** **Trump Deadline Expiry** | PENDING -- window ~March 1-6 | Trump decision point | **Not a commitment ("not scientific") but military buildup makes it credible. Last diplomatic off-ramp: Geneva Round 3, Feb 26. If no deal framework by March 1-6, military option becomes primary.** | [Inference -- Med] |
| **(v1.7)** **IAEA Board Censure / UNSC Referral** | PENDING -- Board meeting March 2 | IAEA censure vote + possible UNSC referral | **Three-clock convergence: Geneva Round 3 (Feb 26) + IAEA Board (March 2-6) + Trump deadline (~March 1-6) compress into single 8-day window. If IAEA refers Iran to UNSC concurrent with failed Round 3, political predicate for strikes strengthens on multiple independent axes. IAEA censure is independently triggerable regardless of Geneva outcome -- feeds Obs 014 (Three Clocks) and A12.6 Phase assessment.** | [Fact -- High for meeting date; Inference -- Med for convergence dynamics] |
| **(v1.7)** **US Internal Military Debate** | ACTIVE -- Caine warning vs. Trump dismissal | Contested | **Joint Chiefs Chairman Caine cautioned Trump: munitions shortfalls (Israel/Ukraine depletion), lack of allied support, significant risk. Trump publicly contradicted. CENTCOM commander Cooper excluded from Iran meetings -- civilian leadership controlling military options. Two readings: (a) genuine strain signal advancing regime Phase 3 assessment; (b) deliberate leak to prevent regime slow-play. Regime likely perceiving this as opponent strain indicator (A12.5.1). Monitoring: Caine public statements; Cooper inclusion/exclusion; munitions resupply pace.** | [Fact -- High; Washington Post, Axios] |
| **(v1.7)** **UK Diego Garcia Refusal** | ACTIVE -- UK refuses basing for Iran strikes | Constraining | **PM Starmer indicated US cannot use British airbases (Diego Garcia, RAF Fairford) for Iran strikes -- would breach international law. Constrains B-2 basing options for bunker-buster operations. Feeds opponent strain perception (allied non-support).** | [Fact -- High; Al Jazeera] |

### TABLE 4: POSITIVE OPTIONALITY

| Variable | Advantage | Metric | Strategic Value | Confidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **National Identity** | Civilizational continuity | 2,500+ years | **Cohesion anchor vs. all comparators** | [High] |
| **Education Level** | Literate, educated population | ~97% youth literacy | **Governance capacity exceeds Iraq/Libya/Afghanistan** | [Med] |
| **Diaspora Professional Base** | Engineers, doctors, lawyers, academics | 2-4M in advanced economies | **Skills reservoir for post-transition** | [Med] |
| **Energy Resources** | Massive oil/gas reserves | 3rd oil, 2nd gas globally | **Economic foundation post-sanctions** | [High] |
| **Geographic Position** | Strategic crossroads | Gulf-Central Asia-South Asia | **Natural trade hub** | [High] |
| **Proxy Degradation** | Hezbollah decimated; QF weakened | Post-2024/2025 | **Reduced external spoiler capacity** | [Med] |
| **Parallel Society Internal Hollowness** | Most members bound by economics, not ideology | Golkar (academic), Azizi (Yale), 2009 behavioral evidence | **Disaggregation possible: economic alternatives can separate majority from core** | [Inference -- Med] |
| **Demographic Bet Failure** | Regime cannot outbreed opposition | National TFR 1.7; no evidence of IRGC differential | **Time favors broader population, not regime** | [Inference -- Med] |
| **(v1.3)** **Bar Association Institutional Survival** | ~70,000 independent lawyers; institutional memory of independence dating to 1953 (Mossadegh) | Constrained but persistent | **Only judicial institution with legitimate claim to independence. Survived three formal closures. Diaspora amplifier: Iranian-American Bar Association alone has 1,500+ members. Fastest path to judicial reconstruction backbone.** | [Inference — Med-High] |
| **(v1.3)** **Parliamentary Infrastructure (Election Machinery)** | 12 elections conducted since 1980; polling stations, voter rolls, regional constituencies physically exist | Intact (hardware); captured (software) | **The obstacle to free elections is the vetting superstructure, not the machinery. Remove Guardian Council vetting → existing infrastructure supports free elections without rebuilding. This advantage partially survives even the ratchet — infrastructure exists regardless of who uses it.** | [Inference — Med] |

## NORMALIZATION QUALITY VARIABLES (Session 12 — F12)

| Code | Variable | Type | Description | Threshold / Range |
|------|----------|------|-------------|------------------|
| NQ-01 | NIOC-IRGC separation index | Stock | Whether IRGC commanders hold NIOC board/leadership positions | Binary: yes = Type B blocked; no = Type B condition met |
| NQ-02 | KAA competitive bidding rate | Flow | % of Iranian construction contracts awarded via competitive process (verifiable via Iranian procurement records) | >50% = meaningful reform; 0% = unchanged |
| NQ-03 | Western oil major IPC contract status | Stock | Number of Western oil majors (TotalEnergies, Shell, BP, Eni, ExxonMobil) with signed IPC contracts | 0 = hollow deal; ≥1 = Type B unlocking |
| NQ-04 | Diaspora capital repatriation flows | Flow | Annual documented investment flows from diaspora to Iran (USD) | Baseline: ~$0 under sanctions/hollow deal; meaningful repatriation = governance signal |
| NQ-05 | IRGC bank ownership index | Stock | % of Iranian banking assets with IRGC ownership in chain | >25% = Type B correspondent banking blocked |
| NQ-06 | Chabahar operational actor | Stock | India vs. China as Shahid Beheshti terminal operator | India = Type A normalization pathway active; China = China vacuum proceeding |
| NQ-07 | South Pars development actor | Stock | Chinese vs. Western primary developer of Iranian side of field | Western entry = Type B; Chinese expansion only = hollow/Type A |
| NQ-08 | IRGC oil revenue share (statutory) | Stock | % of oil/gas export revenue allocated to IRGC by budget law | 51% (2025 baseline) = any sanctions relief is IRGC enrichment; reduction requires deal conditionality |
| NQ-09 | EU IRGC designation status | Stock | Whether EU IRGC terrorist designation remains in force | Active = Type B blocked for EU companies (criminal liability); reversed = requires unanimous EU Council vote |
| NQ-10 | Oman re-export Iran revenue | Flow | Annual Oman re-export revenues to Iran (USD) | $803M (2024 baseline) — growth = mediation interest continues; decline = direct channels opening |

*Variables require weekly recheck on flow and threshold tables. Stock variables recheck monthly or on significant event.*
*v1.2 NOTE (still active): Given active mourning cycle, Hormuz exercise tempo, and campaign-ready US force posture, flow and threshold variables should be rechecked every 3-5 days until situation stabilizes or transitions to a new phase.*
*v1.3 NOTE: Paydari trajectory and Ghalibaf timeline variables are election-cycle dependent (2028); monitor Guardian Council candidate approval patterns in 2027 as leading indicator. Judicial moratorium threshold is instantaneous upon any transition event -- no warning lag.*
*v1.5 NOTE (CRITICAL): Trump deadline variables, Iran proposal delivery, Geneva Round 3 outcome, and student protest expansion require DAILY monitoring through at least March 6. The system is in maximum-velocity phase. Multiple variables are converging on a ~10-day decision window (Feb 22 to ~March 3). Any individual variable crossing its threshold may cascade the others.*
*v1.7 NOTE (Session 16): IAEA Board (March 2) creates third independent clock converging with Geneva Round 3 and Trump deadline. This is the tightest multi-clock convergence documented in the project. Student protest expansion (12+ universities) now modeled as independent internal resistance clock (A12.3.6). Caine/Cooper dynamics create new variable in Washington Patience Clock. All three factors require monitoring through at least March 6.*
